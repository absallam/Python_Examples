Welcome to python Examples! Here you'll find many good python examples to practice, 
All examples are from tasks & challenges i've come across, solved and confirmed that they work. 
As at the time i created this repo upto the time i started Git pushing (not long ago), I'm still very much a beginner. 
I wrote the codes as easy to grasp as i possibly can (Beginner level) so other python beginners will easily understand. 
Please Note: Each example contains a docstring that briefly explains what the code does.
and #comments to guide you through steps in each program example.
