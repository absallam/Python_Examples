As the name implies, here you'll find many python examples. 
Many of this examples are result from tasked/challenges i've come across, solved and confirmed that they work. 
As at the time i created this repo upto the time i started Git pushing (Not long ago), I'm still very much a beginner. 
I wrote the codes as easy to grasp as i possibly can (Beginner level) so other python beginners will easily understand. 
Please Note: Each example contains a docstring that briefly explains what the code does.
