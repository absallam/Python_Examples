As the name implies, here you'll find many python examples.
Many of this examples are result from tasked/challenges i've come across,
solved and confirmed that they work. 
As at the time i created this repository upto the time i started Git pushing (Now), 
I'm still very much a beginner. I wrote the codes as easy to grasp as i possibly can(as though i know pther ways, lol), 
so other beginner will understand the codes with ease.

Please Note: Each example contains a docstring that briefly explains what the code does.
